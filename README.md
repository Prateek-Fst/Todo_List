# React To-Do Application

This is a simple To-Do application built using React, Material-UI, and Redux for state management. The application allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and toggle the completion status of tasks. Tasks are persistently stored in the browser's local storage, so they are not lost on page reload.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task using the input field and the "Add Task" button.
- **View Tasks**: All added tasks are displayed in a list format.
- **Edit Task**: Each task can be edited.
- **Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Tasks can be marked as completed or uncompleted by clicking on them.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in local storage to persist across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building responsive web applications.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **Local Storage**: Browser's local storage to persist data.
